    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        I love this dish! It reminds me of potlucks and summertime. It's full of every texture--warm, cool, crisp, soft, crunchy. 
        <br>
        It has a touch of sweetness and tanginess from the dressing, and the lovely nacho cheese flavor from the chips, with the taco-seasoned meat. It all works together deliciously and is a quick and easy meal that's ready to go anytime.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>

        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>

        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>¼ cup water</li>

        <li>1 ½ tablespoons taco seasoning mix</li>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) can dark red kidney beans, drained</li>

        <li>½ (12 ounce) bag nacho cheese-flavored corn chips (such as Doritos®), crushed</li>

        <li>1 large head romaine lettuce, chopped</li>

        <li>1 ½ medium tomatoes, diced</li>

        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or more to taste</li>

        <li>½ cup Catalina salad dressing, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium to medium-high heat and saute ground beef, diced onion, salt, and pepper together until ground beef is browned and no longer pink and onions are tender, about 10 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water and taco seasoning to the meat. Stir to coat and allow to simmer for 1 minute to thicken. Set aside to cool while you prep the salad.</li>
        <li>Add kidney beans, crushed chips, lettuce, tomatoes, Cheddar cheese, and dressing to a large bowl. Top with meat mixture and toss gently to evenly combine. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
